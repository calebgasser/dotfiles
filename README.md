# Dotfiles

All my dot files.

# Usage

- `build-system.sh` for system specific programs.
- `build-home.sh` for home manager files (most the programs).

# TODO

- Obisidan currently has to have hardware hardware acceleration turned off. At least for gnome desktop. Keep on eye on if this gets fixed.
